"""txsessionmgr - Python module for a single persistent connection to a device
for multiple clients.

Useful for situations when multiple connections to a device can be handled
with one connection through a single login, e.g. txciscoapic, txwinrm

The global SESSION_MANAGER is instantiated one time and is used to manage
all sessions

Session should be subclassed and implemented to login/logout, send requests,
and handle responses

A Client should always have a key property.  This will be unique to the types
of transactions/requests being made through a single Session
